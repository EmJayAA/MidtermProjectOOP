Midterm Project OOP

  Project Overview
      As part of my midterm requirements, I am tasked to design and implement a consolebased Student Record Management System applying Linked List data structures and
      Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
      
      This project is essentially a "Student Record System", where it emulates real life scenarios of keeping student records. As part of the project requirements, 
      this program allows the user to perform the following operations:
      - Add Student
      - Delete Student
      - Search Student
      - Update Student
      - Display All Students

      The program demonstrates concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** such as classes, objects, enums, and linked list structures.
